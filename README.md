==============

Various BST Questions implemented in Java

1)Check if a tree is a Mirror Image

2)Given Inorder and Pre Order traversal construct a BST

3)Height/Depth of a tree

4)Given a sorted array create a BST with minimal height

5)Balance tree ie Check if a tree is balanced

note a tree is balanced if the ht of the left subtree and the rt subtree differ by 1 atmost

6)Check if a tree is a valid BST.

7)Common ancestor problem.
